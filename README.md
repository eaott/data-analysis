# data-analysis
Trying to publish the book
TODO: change repo name to data-analysis-book or something
TODO: move this repo to UTAustinSPS's control
TODO: make this repo a submodule under UTAustinSPS/data-analysis as /static
TODO: add a script to UTAustinSPS to publish by committing changes in this repo (/static in the other repo) and pushing them up. That way, can make a bunch of edits and keep them available somewhere, but put the actual book on a server with a lot less space (only static stuff + diffs), and host it more easily. Can host on evanott.com and SPS page.
